Created project on a bank fund management, implemented multilevel 
inheritance to create linkage between all the classes and used files to store 
the date and retrieve it permanently.
â€¢ Tested scenarios: 
  * When user deposit/withdraw amount in state wise branches (eg: 
class Tamil Nadu) then the respective deposit/withdraw amount will 
be added to parent classes with the help of super functionality. 
  * Once all the transactions are done, the respective totals of all the 
parent and child classes will be stored in a file for permanent storage 
and retrieval.
